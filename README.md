## Description
In this mini project I am running a pandas script that takes data from a FIFA CSV file and performs some descriptive statistics on it.
Descriptive statistics include:
* Mean population share
* Top 5 countries with the highest TV audience
* Top 5 countries with the highest GDP
* Number of countries in each confederation

In addition, this project incorporates GitHub actions:
* Format
* Install
* Lint
